# A required list of local or remote repositories with paths and
# optional labels (which can be used with the --repository flag to
# select a repository). Tildes are expanded. Multiple repositories are
# backed up to in sequence. Borg placeholders can be used. See the
# output of "borg help placeholders" for details. See ssh_command for
# SSH options like identity file or port. If systemd service is used,
# then add local repository paths in the systemd service file to the
# ReadWritePaths list. Prior to borgmatic 1.7.10, repositories was a
# list of plain path strings.
repositories:
    - path: ssh://user@backupserver/./sourcehostname.borg
      label: backupserver
    - path: /mnt/backup
      label: local

# The standard output of this command is used to unlock the encryption
# key. Only use on repositories that were initialized with
# passcommand/repokey/keyfile encryption. Note that if both
# encryption_passcommand and encryption_passphrase are set, then
# encryption_passphrase takes precedence. Defaults to not set.
# encryption_passcommand: secret-tool lookup borg-repository repo-name

# Passphrase to unlock the encryption key with. Only use on
# repositories that were initialized with passphrase/repokey/keyfile
# encryption. Quote the value if it contains punctuation, so it parses
# correctly. And backslash any quote or backslash literals as well.
# Defaults to not set.
encryption_passphrase: "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~"

# Alternative: use a passcommand
# encryption_passcommand: cat path/to/borg-repokey

# --> Override the ssh command if needed
# Command to use instead of "ssh". This can be used to specify ssh
# options. Defaults to not set.
# ssh_command: ssh -i /path/to/private/key

# --> Override compression for slow connections if fast processor present
# Type of compression to use when creating archives. (Compression
# level can be added separated with a comma, like "zstd,7".) See
# http://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/create.html for
# details. Defaults to "lz4".
# compression: auto,zlib,3
